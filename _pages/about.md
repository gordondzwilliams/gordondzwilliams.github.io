I am an environmental and isotope geochemist, currently a PhD candidate in the [Vengosh Lab] (https://sites.nicholas.duke.edu/avnervengosh/) at Duke University.

My research focuses on lithium, a critical element for the clean energy transition. I study how lithium-brine deposits form and evolve, and how the extraction of lithium-brines and hard-rock pegmatites impacts water quality and the environment. By combining fieldwork and laboratory geochemistry, my work aims to advance understanding of Earth processes while supporting more sustainable approaches to resource development.
